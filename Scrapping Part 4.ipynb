       " \"Vedansh Parasharmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyJuly 21, 2020It's the best app out there for learning new words everything is great but can you provide some of the pro features like words from movies and TV shows for free version. And when I want to use these features by choosing to view ads,ads don't run. But I'm really happy to see such an innovative and elegant app with such great features. Please give a thought about some of the pro features for free.((I don't care about ads till they are in limits)) Thankyou...77 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGeeks LtdJuly 21, 2020Thank you for your feedback.
